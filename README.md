# korean-lookup
A GUI that lets the user type in Korean and search for definitions and verb/adjective conjugations, without the need for a Korean keyboard. Originally made becauase I was tired of having to use an online keyboard to type Korean, copy that text into another tab, and search both the definition and conjuagtions (of which the Korean language has many). So I wrote a little program that did all of those in one, with some limitations. First, the definitions are pulled from exact matches from [Kpedia](http://www.kpedia.jp/), so if the input is not found on there, then you might need to check the spelling, or perform an outside search (some words such as 왕가 simply do not have an entry). The verb/adjective conjugations are found on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/), so if verb/adjective conjugations are not found, then it's very likely you're not using the dictionary form, or the entry simply might not exist (less likely).

## spelling
The search box will automatically replace the Roman characters typed once the ```SPACE``` bar is pressed, so hit ```SPACE``` for EACH Hangeul block you want to compose, as it will only convert the last valid block. The spelling is somewhat strict, as ᄀ ALWAYS is equivalent to 'g', not 'k', even at the end of a word. Similarly with ᄅ ('l'), ᄑ ('p'), ᄐ ('t'), etc...
